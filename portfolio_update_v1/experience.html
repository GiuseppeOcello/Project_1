        <h2>Something about my coding carrer</h2>
            <p>It all started with the need for performing advance operations in <span>Excel</span> and dealing with large tables. There I discovered <span>VBA</span> and its potentiality.
            After creating dozens of VBA projects and forms, I looked at a way to building small windows application using the same language and downloaded <span>Visual Studio</span>. I designed a few calculation's software that I then shared with my colleagues.</p>
            <p>After a long time of non-coding, I got again fascinated, and I wanted to create my android application, so I began to look for video tutorials on <span>Java</span>, that is when I saw the first advert about <span>Treehouse</span> (about three years ago).
            I started with the 25$ plan to begin learning <span>Java</span>, but it was a busy period form me, and I had to suspend after a few months.</p> 
            <p>After some time I restarted, but I realize that building android applications would have taken some time, and since I had in mind to lunch my first web site I chosen to follow the tracks about web design, <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and the <span>lovely JavaSript</span>.
            At the same period, a colleague of mine told me that I could have built a web site using <span>WordPress</span> without coding needed, and since I wanted to hurry up, I launched my consultancy site.</p>
            <p>However, I wanted to offer engineering web apps, and since you do not code your site, I had to find a way to code on WordPress, which is not easy and the result is buggy.</p>
            <p>Finally, I have chosen to start the website from scratch, and this is my ample opportunity to learn web development and Full-Stack following the current Techdegree.</p>
            <p>It has been an unconstant path with many things forgotten along the way, but my target for 2021 is to no longer delay what I like.<p>
            <p>No matter how good you are at something <strong>if you do not practice, you will forget</strong>.</p>
